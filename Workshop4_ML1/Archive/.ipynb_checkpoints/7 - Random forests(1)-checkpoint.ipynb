    "We've seen the problem of overfitting in the previous notebook. There is a way to reverse overfitting (**regularization**) called **pruning**. Let's go through the steps of pruning a tree. (Pruning a tree is actually a horticultural expression used for cutting off branches to make the plant grow better in the future.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have separated your data set into three parts for this. A **training set**, a **validation set**, and a **test set**. Once you have learned a tree on the training set you take the validation set and start cutting away at the tree: for example removing some of the leaf nodes. You then use the validation set to make sure that the tree does *not* lose any predictive power when cutting away these branches. If it does decrease an accurate prediction you're cutting away a crucial branch, so better put it back!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you can apply the tree to the test set for the final check that you have a model that is not overfitted."

    "A forest is also a method of **regularization**. Instead of cutting away branches that were overfitted you keep the overfitted tree, but simply generate lots of trees. Each tree is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the training data, so each tree is slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what do you call a set of many trees.... a **random forest**!\n",
    "\n",
    "When a prediction has to be made each tree is asked to go through its nodes and determine the outcome. This outcome is then cast as a vote by each tree. The forest looks at all the votes and sticks with the majority. The idea being that each tree will be overfitted differently than all the others, but the general trend is learned in all trees! Some trees will cast some ridiculous vote, but as long as they are in the minority the forest as a whole predicts correctly."
